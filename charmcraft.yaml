        The dictionary inside the secret should be key-value pairs that map directly to the options required by the plugin.
        All keys are expected to be in lowercase with dashes instead of underscores.
        You can find the required options for your chosen plugin in the [LEGO documentation](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns).
        For example, the `route53` plugin requires a `secret-access-key` and `access-key-id` to be set.
